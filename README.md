# HW 08

## Part 1

To detect the colors, I set variables for the r, g, and b values in the pixel formula of (r, g, b, alpha) which terates every 4 places. I set an if statement for this sequence that checked if the r, g, and b values were at their maxiumum and if they were significantly higher than the other color values to ensure only really vibrant parts of the image changed. 

I decided to change red to blue, green to yellow, and blue to a random color initiated by the button click.

When I ran my sketch on a different image, the colors did change as expected but the image did not resize. I am not sure why this is.
