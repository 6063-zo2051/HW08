# HW 08

## Part 1

To detect the colors, I set variables for the r, g, and b values in the pixel formula of (r, g, b, alpha) which terates every 4 places. I set an if statement for this sequence that checked if the r, g, and b values were at their maxiumum and if they were significantly higher than the other color values to ensure only really vibrant parts of the image changed. 

I decided to change red to blue, green to yellow, and blue to a random color initiated by the button click.

When I ran my sketch on a different image, the colors did change as expected but the image did not resize. I am not sure why this is.

## Part 2

I picked an interlude by one of my favorite artists Mariah the Scientist. I just made the visualization a moving line as I had struggled with getting it to work due to the incorrect html line in my index section. I made another button click that created a round of the song. The line moves back as you play a new round of song. I thought that this created a cool mixing effect and could probably go further by creating a DJ mixing table, maybe for a furuture project of the final!
